          "content": "As a key developer, I integrated various open-source tools with the STAC standard alongside developing custom compliant microservices. My focus was on developing functionalities that enable users to draw an Area of Interest (AOI), specify temporal extents, and set parameters like cloud-cover. This included parsing metadata and displaying it effectively on the STAC Portal."
